Happy Numbers
=============

From [Rosetta code project](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Happy_numbers):

Task: Find and print the first 8 happy numbers.

> A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with
any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of
its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it
will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers,
while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.
